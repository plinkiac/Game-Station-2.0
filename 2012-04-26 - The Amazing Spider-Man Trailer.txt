Hi, I'm Tara, and welcome to another episode of Game Splation 2.1
well, a new summer season of movies is almost upon us, and you know what that means
it's time for reboots and remakes
just one month after Sam Raimi completed his spider-man trilogy, Sony gears up to relaunch the Caped Crusader back on the big screen
and this time, Andrew Garfield from the social network Don's the famous costume of the Man of Steel
and Marc Webb directs
no, that's not a joke
his last name actually is Webb
let's subject our picky, ultra-nerdy spider-man fan, rich Evans, to this new trailer as we enter the game station 2.0
ugh
oh, my god
these old fashioned cell phones
it's so hard it's text on
oh, my god
ugh
shit
why, hello rich Evans
what the fuck
who are you
I'm Android 221, but I like to be called Liz
I service all the men on the game station
you, what
oh
oh, no, no
it's not what you think
I have sex with them
oh
I'm also programmed to deliver data tell the game stations
yeah
what kind of data
well, today I have the new spider-man trailer
the overlords want your opinion on this because your profile says you're a spider-man expert
oh
how did you get out there fire escape it's 20 stories
your doorman's intimidating tell us a
little bit about yourself Parker not
much to tell really Peter lives with his
aunt and uncle I'm kind of curious about
how they're going to alter the origin
uncle Uncle Ben was there yeah it is he
was Martin Sheen yeah that's that's you
have to respect him he was our president
you know if you're gonna steal cars
don't dress like a car key you a cop
you seriously think I'm a cop and the
skin tie red and blue suit so what I did
like is that it looked like they were
going back to the original idea of him
creating the the web weapon as opposed
to it being whether shooters the web
shooter could I've had this debate with
other Androids before where if he were
really anatomically bitten by a spider
and it was if he would just be flying by
his ass around New York which is a
really funny mental picture but I always
hated the organics just because it makes
Peter Parker like weird Peter Parker's
you know relatable every man human jigum
like weird things honest like an orifice
from her lips wedding that's creepy well
and it's just weirdly Freudian too yeah
yeah
your father was a very secretive man
Peter dr. Connors
I'm Richard Parker's son I'm slightly
more enthusiastic than I was for the
teaser trailer which I hated well I was
really worried in the teaser trailer
they kept talking about secrets yeah
they're ours yes well the thing the
thing that I I like about the reboot is
no one seems quite as wooden as Kirsten
Dunst
I hated Tobey Maguire well I hated them
I mean everybody I didn't like anyone
except Willem Dafoe and they got rid of
him right away
so Tobey Maguire was like a one-note
spider-man told me where I was like
garlic like goody-goody golly-gee shacks
and now it's like they've gone to the
opposite extreme but that's apparent
that's how you reboot a franchise
apparently Herman has to have a sense of
humor he has to and I think he can have
a sense of humor and still have a dark
side he's sitting there with his
feathered hair he's all watch yeah he's
serious in that trailer yeah but you're
seeing the clips that is one side the
teaser trailer was one side of the movie
this was another side in the movie I'm
sure they could take and it a bunch of
different clips and make it seem like it
was the feel-good film with the summer I
can only go on what I've seen oh I don't
I don't know what the end result is
going to be based on what I've seen I am
extremely worried it's me it's not going
to be a spy remember it's gonna be some
kind of bizarre bizarre Twilight
superhero guy
well I've got to go
it's been fun talking spider-man with
you unit 603 idiot
wait will I ever see you again well
considering that this space stations
atmosphere is made of thorough hexie on
which is a substance that inhibits
cellular decay for about six thousand
years I'd say your chances are pretty
good what
