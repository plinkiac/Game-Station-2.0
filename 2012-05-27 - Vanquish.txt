Hi, I'm Tara, and welcome to another episode of Game Station 2.0
having been released in October of 2010, Vanquish may be considered old by videogame standards
but that's not going to stop the Game Station from reviewing it
how else are we going to take away precious minutes of your life that you'll never get back
let's check out the review of this ancient game from the creators of the Resident Evil series as rich Evans enters the game station 2.0
or whatever it's called
oh, they got someone to fill this room after the last guy died mysteriously
huh
hi, I'm Jay
I'm in 609
oh, hi
I'm rich
how did you get out of your game station
oh, the door's always open
yeah, but every time I try to leave they they close right in my face
huh
that's weird
hey, I'm supposed to review this game vanquish today
but I really just kind of don't feel like
it do you think you could just take care of that for me
they don't yell at you when your reviews aren't finished on time
yeah
they're pretty laid-back around here
I'm gonna go take a nap
huh
I recently saw the trailer for Metal Gear Rising by platinum games
and it reminded me a lot of one of their last titles, vanquish, from back in 2010
both games have over-the-top action and giant robots
what I don't understand is why vanquish was so overlooked
in vanquish, you play as Solid Snake
err, I mean Sam Gideon, the test pilot for an experimental accelerator suit that speeds up his reaction times
it also has thrusters built into it that allow you to speed from cover to cover or also from one end of the battlefield to the other in no time flat
the game takes place in the future and the Russians are communists again
you'll have to keep the space commies from using a giant spaceman microwave from frying New York City
it's not particularly deep, but it's not trying to be
and it works fine for what it is
a simple framework to hang an excellent action game on
vanquish was like the next evolution of third-person shooters
they took a cover based shooter, much like Gears of War, and they strapped rocket boots on its feet
this element of speed changes everything
Gears of War is by and large a plotting game
usually, its mark just to stay behind cover and take potshots at your enemies
vanquished changes all of that
you can still sit behind cover and snipe
but why do that when you can leap over the cover and use your rocket boots to glide behind enemy lines
all the while using bullet time to unleash a full clip on your enemy on the way there
or you can power slide into an enemy robot and knock it back and then flip off into the air and unload a shotgun to its face, all in slow motion
hey, uh, I'm having an orgy down in my room
you're not invited, of course, but could I borrow some ice from your minibar
minibar
wait you have a minibar
yeah
this is the greatest job I've ever had
job
you mean you get paid
fuck my life
there are a bunch of different weapons to be found in vanquish
from the tried and true shotguns sniper rifles or rocket launchers
but vanquish also has some unique weaponry more specialized armament
there's the disc launcher which shoots out spinning buzz saws that can shear off enemy limbs
or the lock-on laser that can target multiple enemies at once
you can upgrade weapons so by the end of the game your standard assault rifle can be pretty beastly
each weapon also has its own unique melee attack
and all of the different animations for them can be pretty fun to watch
for instance the melee attack for the heavy machine gun will have you do a powerful kick which will send you up into the air allowing you to shoot enemies hided behind cover
it's worth mentioning that vanquish is the most fun I've had with a shotgun since doom 2
it has a powerful knock back
so it's really quite fun to jump right into a large group of smaller robots and send them flying back
or knock them out of their feet as they leap at you
the two complaints I've heard levelled about this game and that the story is cheesy and that there is no multiplayer
the story is really a non-issue
it's deliberately cheesy and over-the-top and it's really just an excuse to have an action game
the lack of multiplayer should not keep you from playing this game
it's the single best single-player third-person shooter I've ever played
the game is a complete blast hell I hate QuickTime events and even the QuickTime events in this game are fun
vanquish has been out for a couple of years now
you can probably find a copy pretty cheap somewhere I highly recommend you give it a try
