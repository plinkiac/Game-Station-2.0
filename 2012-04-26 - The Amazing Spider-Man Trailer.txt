TARA:
Hi, I'm Tara, and welcome to another episode of Game X-Playtion 2.1. Well, a new summer season of movies is almost upon us, and you know what that means: it's time for reboots and remakes. Just one month after Sam Raimi completed his Spider-Man trilogy, Sony gears up to relaunch the Caped Crusader back on the big screen. And this time, Andrew Garfield from the Social Network dons the famous costume of the Man of Steel. And Marc Webb directs. No, that's not a joke. His last name actually is Webb. Let's subject our picky, ultra-nerdy Spider-Man fan, Rich Evans, to this new trailer as we enter the Game Station 2.0.

RICH:
Ugh. Oh, my god. These old fashioned cell phones are so hard it's text on. Oh, my god. Ugh. Shit.

LIZ:
Why, hello Rich Evans.

RICH:
What the fuck? Who are you?

LIZ:
I'm Android 221, but I like to be called Liz. I service all the men on the game station.

RICH:
You...what?

LIZ:
Oh. Oh, no, no. It's not what you think. I have sex with them.

RICH:
Oh.

LIZ:
I'm also programmed to deliver data to all the game stations.

RICH:
Yeah? What kind of data?

LIZ:
Well, today I have the new Spider-Man trailer. The overlords want your opinion on this because your profile says you're a Spider-Man expert.

RICH:
Oh.

CLIP:
"How did you get out there?"

CLIP:
"Fire escape."

CLIP:
"It's 20 stories."

CLIP:
"Your doorman's intimidating."

CLIP:
"Tell us a little bit about yourself, Mr. Parker."

CLIP:
"Not much to tell, really."

CLIP:
"Peter lives with his aunt and uncle."

RICH:
I'm kind of curious about how they're going to alter the origin. Uncle, Uncle Ben was there.

LIZ:
Yes.

RICH:
It, it...

LIZ:
And he was Martin Sheen.

RICH:
Yeah, that's, that's...

LIZ:
You have to respect him. He was our president.

CLIP:
"You know, if you're gonna steal cars, don't dress like a car thief."

CLIP:
"You a cop?"

CLIP:
"You seriously think I'm a cop, in this red and blue suit?"

LIZ:
So, what I did like, is that it looked like they were going back to the original idea of him creating the, the web weapon, as opposed to it being...

RICH:
Web shooters.

LIZ:
The web shooter. I've had this debate with other androids before where, if he were really anatomically bitten by a spider, and it was, he would just be flying by his ass around New York, which is a really funny mental picture, but...

RICH:
I always hated the organics, just because it makes Peter Parker, like, weird. Peter Parker's, you know, relatable, every man human. Give him, like, weird things honest like an orifice for, for webs. That's creepy.

LIZ:
Well, and it's just weirdly Freudian, too.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.

CLIP:
"Your father was a very secretive man, Peter."

CLIP:
"Dr. Connors, I'm Richard Parker's son."

RICH:
I'm slightly more enthusiastic than I was for the teaser trailer, which I hated. Well, I was really worried in the teaser trailer, when they kept talking about secrets.

LIZ:
Yeah.

RICH:
There are secrets.

LIZ:
Well, the thing, the thing that I I like about the reboot is no one seems quite as wooden as Kirsten Dunst.

RICH:
I hated Tobey Maguire.

LIZ:
Well, I hated them. I mean, everybody, I didn't like anyone except Willem Dafoe, and they got rid of him right away.

RICH:
So, Tobey Maguire was, like, a one-note Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire was, like, a goody-goody, golly-gee shucks, and now it's like they've gone to the opposite extreme.

LIZ:
But that's apparent, that's how you reboot a franchise. Apparently.

RICH:
Spider-Man has to have a sense of humor. He has to.

LIZ:
And I think he can have a sense of humor and still have a dark side.

RICH:
He's sitting there with his feathered hair. He's all, he's not serious in that trailer.

LIZ:
Yeah, but you're seeing the clips, that is one side, the teaser trailer was one side of the movie. This was another side in the movie. I'm sure they could take a bunch of different clips and make it seem like it was the feel-good film with the summer.

RICH:
I can only go on what I've seen. I don't, I don't know what the end result is going to be. But based on what I've seen, I am extremely worried. To me, it's not going to be a Spider-Man movie. It's gonna be some kind of bizarre, bizarre Twilight superhero guy. 

LIZ:
Well, I've got to go. It's been fun talking Spider-Man with you, Unit 603-Idiot.

RICH:
Wait. Will I ever see you again?

LIZ:
Well, considering that this space station's atmosphere is made of thorough hexion, which is a substance that inhibits cellular decay for about 6,000 years, I'd say your chances are pretty good.

RICH:
What?
